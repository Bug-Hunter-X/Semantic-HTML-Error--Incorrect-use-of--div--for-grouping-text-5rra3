<p>This is a common HTML error that can be easily overlooked:</p><code><div><p>This is some text.</p><p>This is some more text.</p></div></code><p>While this may appear correct, it violates the principle of semantic HTML.  Div elements are generic containers.  When you want to group paragraphs of text, the semantically correct element is a <code style="color:blue">&lt;section&gt;</code> or <code style="color:blue">&lt;article&gt;</code> element.</p><p>Using divs in this situation can lead to accessibility problems and issues with search engine optimization (SEO).  Screen readers and search engines might not interpret the content as a coherent block of text intended as a section or article.</p>
